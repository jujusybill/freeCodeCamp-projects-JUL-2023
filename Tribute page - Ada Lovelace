        <ul>
          <li>Ada was born in December of 1815 in London, England to Lord and Lady Byron. Her father was a poet and mother was a highly educated and a very strict religious woman.</li></br>
          <li>She was originally interested in phrenology (study of the shape and size of the cranium as a supposed indication of character and mental abilities) and mesmerism (or animal magnetism) before delving into mathematics and computation.</li></br>
          <li>Ada wrote her first algorithm in late 1842 after attending a lecture by Charles Babbage on his Analytical Engine.</li></br>
          <li>In her notes and article on "Note G", Ada even dismissed the idea of <b>artificial intelligence</b>, arguing that "the Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths". </li></br>
          <li>There are many forms of commemoration for her contribution to programming and mathematics, including a programming language, prizes, initiatives, and academies to honor Ada Lovelace.</li></br>
